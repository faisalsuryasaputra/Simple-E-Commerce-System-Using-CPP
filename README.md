# Simple E-Commerce System Using C++
This final project aims to implement Data Structure concepts using the C++ programming language through the development of a simple console-based E-Commerce system. The program is designed to manage product data and sales transactions by applying a multilevel linked list data structure.
In this system, products (Barang) are stored as nodes in the main linked list, while each product can have multiple transactions (Transaksi) stored in a child linked list. Each transaction is directly associated with a specific product, forming a hierarchical data structure that reflects real-world e-commerce relationships.
The application provides several core features, including:
Adding products at the beginning or end of the linked list
Displaying all stored products
Adding transactions to a selected product
Displaying products along with their transactions
Searching for and updating product data
Searching for and updating transaction data
Deleting a transaction from a product
Deleting a product along with all its associated transactions
Calculating the total value of all transactions
Through this project, students are expected to understand and apply:
Single Linked List and Multilevel Linked List structures
Dynamic memory management using pointers
Fundamental data structure operations such as insertion, searching, updating, deletion, and traversal
The application of data structures to real-world problems, particularly in simple e-commerce systems
Overall, this project not only strengthens programming skills in C++, but also enhances logical and structured thinking in designing data-driven applications.
